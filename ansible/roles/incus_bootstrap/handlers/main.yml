# Handlers for incus_bootstrap role
# Handlers are tasks that respond to notifications from other tasks
# and are only executed when notified
#
# NOTE: Incus uses systemd socket activation (incus.socket) which automatically
# starts incusd.service on-demand when the socket receives connections.
# Therefore, manual service restart handlers are not required after package
# installation. The socket-based architecture ensures the daemon starts
# automatically when needed.
