# Handlers for incus_container role
#
# This role does not currently require handlers as all operations are
# performed directly in tasks without needing deferred actions:
#   - Container creation: Immediate via `incus init`
#   - Cloud-init configuration: Applied before first start
#   - Container start: Immediate via `incus start`
#   - IP address acquisition: Polled until available
#
# Unlike services (e.g., Docker) that need restart handlers when configuration
# changes, Incus containers are configured before starting, eliminating the
# need for restart-on-change patterns.
