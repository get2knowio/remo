# Incus Containers Inventory
#
# This file defines containers managed by the incus_container role.
# Containers can be added here manually after creation, or they will be
# dynamically registered during provisioning using add_host.
#
# HOW TO ADD CONTAINERS:
# ----------------------
# 1. Uncomment the example entry below (or copy it)
# 2. Replace the container name (e.g., 'dev-container') with your container's name
# 3. Set ansible_host to the container's IP address (assigned via DHCP from incusbr0)
# 4. Optionally customize ansible_user if not using the default 'ubuntu'
# 5. Update ansible_ssh_private_key_file if using a different key
#
# FINDING CONTAINER IPs:
# ----------------------
# Run: incus list
# The IPv4 column shows the assigned IP address.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# --------
# If you created a container named 'my-dev-box' with IP 10.180.234.51:
#
#   my-dev-box:
#     ansible_host: 10.180.234.51
#     ansible_user: ubuntu
#     ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#

    incus_containers:
      hosts:
        # Example entry - uncomment and modify as needed
        # dev-container:
        #   ansible_host: 10.180.234.50
        #   ansible_user: ubuntu
        #   ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      vars:
        ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
